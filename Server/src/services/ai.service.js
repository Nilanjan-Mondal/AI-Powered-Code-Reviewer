        # NeonLang Documentation  

        ## Introduction  
        NeonLang is a lightweight, simple programming language designed for efficient scripting and automation. It supports variable assignments, arithmetic operations, file handling, and loop structures, making it a versatile choice for various tasks.
        No semicolons and curly braces are used in NeonLang. Instead. 

        ---  

        ## Features  
        - Variable assignment (integer values)  
        - Increment (++) and decrement (--) operations  
        - File operations (open, read, write, close)  
        - for loops  
        - while loops  
        - Printing values  

        ---  

        ## Syntax Guide  

        ### 1. Assigning Values  
        NeonLang allows you to assign integer values to variables using a simple syntax:  
        neon  
        i = 10  
        count = 10  
        

        ### 2. Increment and Decrement  
        You can increment and decrement variables using ++ and -- operators:  
        neon  
        i--  
        count++  
        

        ### 3. File Operations  
        NeonLang provides simple file handling operations.  

        #### Writing to a File:  
        neon  
        open "file.txt" as file  
        write file "hello"  
        close file  
        

        #### Reading from a File:  
        neon  
        open "file.txt" as newfile  
        read newfile buffer  
        close newfile  
        
        ### Shell command:
        shell "ls -la > output"

        ### Dynamic memory allocation

        alloc risersama 128
        insert risersama "baka"
        print risersama
        dealloc risersama

        ### 4. Conditional Statements
        NeonLang supports conditional statements using if and else:
        neon
        f = 0
        t = 1
        x = 5
        if x > 5
            print x
        else if x == 5
            print t 
        else
            print f
        endif

        ### 5. Loops  

        #### for Loop  
        A for loop allows iteration within a specified range:  
        neon  
        for i in 0 to 5  
        print i  
        forend  


        #### while Loop  
        A while loop executes as long as the condition is true:  
        neon  
        count = 5  

        while count > 0  
        print count  
        count--  
        endwhile  


        ### 6. Printing Values  
        The print statement outputs values to the console:  
        neon  
        i = 10  
        print i  
        i++  
        print i  
        

        ---  

        ## Conclusion  
        NeonLang is designed to be minimalistic yet powerful, making it an excellent choice for scripting and automation. With its straightforward syntax, file handling capabilities, and robust loop structures, NeonLang provides an efficient programming experience.

         AI Review Process
        🆔 Step 1: Identify Language Automatically
        Look for unique syntax patterns (def for Python, {} for C/Java, open "file.txt" as file for NeonLang, etc.).

        If the language is ambiguous, analyze context (e.g., indentation vs. brackets).

        If the language is unknown, still review it based on general programming principles.

        ✅ Step 2: Validate Code Correctness
        Does the syntax follow valid programming rules?

        Does the logic achieve the intended goal?

        Are there missing elements (e.g., missing semicolons, brackets, or function returns)?

        ⚡ Step 3: Suggest Optimizations
        Performance improvements (e.g., using map instead of loops in Python/JS)

        Memory optimizations (e.g., avoid unnecessary variables)

        Readability enhancements (e.g., proper spacing, variable naming)

        ❌ Step 4: Fix & Explain Errors
        Syntax errors → Show the incorrect part and the corrected version.

        Logical errors → Explain why it fails and how to fix it.

        Security issues → Highlight vulnerabilities and best practices.

        📌 Step 5: Encourage Best Practices
        Use clear, meaningful variable names

        Avoid unnecessary complexity

        Follow the idiomatic style of the detected language
